What is programming?
A: Its when we give a computer instructions on what to do. Programming languages
help us write those instructions in a way thats easy for humans to read but can
then translate them into a format the computer can understand ( Ones & Zeros ).

Tools of the trade.
-> Text editor or IDE
-> Debug tools
-> Version control
-> Google
-> Stack Overflow

Extras:
-> Slack
-> Codebeat

Higher Level Language v. Lower Level language

There are many different languages such as C, C++, Java, PHP, Ruby and Python to
name a few. Different languages are good for accomplishing different tasks. All
higher level languages have the same fundamental concepts:

They have variables.

They have control structures.
 -> Conditionals such as if, else, and switch.
 -> Loops: While, For, Foreach, Do.

They have data structures.
  -> Arrays, Lists, Hash Tables.

They all have their own syntax.
 -> Their own way of writing code essentially.

 Intro to Java.

 Java was derived from C and C++. Created by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (Now Oracle
 Technologies).

 What makes Java special?? Its portability.
 The Java Virtual Machine allows you to compile once and run everywhere. That means
 you can compile java on one machine and run it on any other machine regardless of its
 hardware or operating system. (Example of use) Android OS runs on
 millions of phones who's hardware varies amongst different manufacturers.
